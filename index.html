                My first computer course at UBC that was taken in the Summer of 2021.
                <br> <br>
                This is an introductory course that used Racket to teach the fundamentals of structuring codes and programming.
                <br> <br>
                The coding/programming aspect was not too hard to follow and included: '...'.
                <br> <br>
                The weekly assignments and labs increased in difficulty, but were very helpful for the exams.

                Taken in the Summer of 2021.
                <br> <br>
                This course touched on: logic circuits, discrete mathematics(...).
                <br> <br>
                There were mandatory weekly labs, four written assignments, and optional tutorials that can get overwhelming.
                <br> <br>
                I had to memorize various laws, symbols, etc. and apply them to solve hard and mostly logical problems.

                Taken in the first term of Winter of 2021. 
                <br> <br>
                This course focused mainly on the design aspect of coding. It also touched on: data structures, debugging, and testing codes.
                <br> <br>
                There were weekly labs, weekly small assignments, and a final project.
                <!-- <br> <br>
                The codings are not hard to understand, but there are a lot of design patterns and components that can get confusing at times.
                <br> <br>
                I loved designing and coding the project for this course and I found this course overall fun and useful. -->

                Taken in the second term of Winter of 2021.
                <br> <br>
                This course was about the architecture of software and I/O as well as operating system. It touched on: CPU, memory, I/O hardwares while also challenges you to code with assembly and asynchronous codes. 
                <br> <br>
                There were weekly labs, weekly tutorials, and weekly assignments.

                I initially found this course easy, but it escalated too quickly. However, some of the subjects taught here (such as deadlocking) are interesting and important for the future. -->

                <br> <br>
                This course was about machine learning: supervised and unsupervised ML. It touched on the principles and how the ML tools work, ethics, and good practices.
                <br> <br>
                It did not dive deep into how the codings of the tools work, but instead only focused on how each tools work and how to apply them in real situations.
                <br> <br>
                There were weekly optional labs, and weekly homeworks.

                Although not hard, this is one of the most engaging class that immensely increases my interest in AI.  -->
