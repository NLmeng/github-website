                <a href=""> <b> CPSC110: Computation, Programs, and Programming </b> </a> 
                <br> <br> My first computer course at UBC that was taken in the Summer of 2021.
                          This is an introductory course that uses Racket to teach the fundamentals of structuring codes and programming.
                          The coding/programming aspect is not too hard to follow, however, I noticed that one specific section (???) is a lot harder than the rest.
                          The weekly assignments and labs increases in difficulty, but are very helpful for the exams.

                <a href=""> <b> CPSC121: Models of Computation </b> </a> 
                <br> <br> Taken in the Summer of 2021. 
                          This course teaches logic circuits and mathematics that are related to computing, commonly known as discrete mathematic.
                          There are mandatory weekly labs, four written assignments, and optional tutorials that can get overwhelming.
                          I had to memorize various laws, symbols, etc. and apply them to solve hard and mostly logical problems.
                          I found this course more challenging than it should have been.

                <a href=""> <b> CPSC210: Software Construction </b> </a> 
                <br> <br> Taken in the first term of Winter of 2021. 
                          This course focuses mainly on the design aspect of coding. It also touches on data structures, debugging, and testing codes.
                          There are weekly labs, weekly small assignments, and a final project.
                          The codings are not hard to understand, but there are a lot of design patterns and components that can get confusing at times.
                          I loved designing and coding the project for this course and I found this course overall fun and useful.

                <br> <br> Taken in the second term of Winter of 2021.
                          This course is about the architecture of software and I/O as well as operating system. 
                          In other words, it touches on CPU, memory, I/O hardwares while also challenges you to code with assembly and goes into the principles of synchronous and asynchronous codes. 
                          There are weekly labs, weekly tutorials, and weekly assignments.
                          I initially found this course easy, but it escalated too quickly. However, some of the subjects taught here (such as deadlocking) are interesting and important for the future.

                <br> <br> Taken in the Summer of 2022.
                          This courses is all about machine learning such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The emphasis is on the principles and how the tools work.
                          It does not dive deep into how the codings of the tools work, but instead only care about how each tools work and how to apply them in real situations.
                          There are weekly optional labs, and weekly homeworks.
                          Although not hard, this is one of the most engaging class that immensely increases my interest in AI.
